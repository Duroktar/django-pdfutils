  Letting base manage styles

- Letting base manage styles. [Dominic Montreuil]

  Mangling self.styles to self.__styles should let classes subclassing ReportBase know that you shouldn't add to styles directly and let the base class manage them.

  The reason in this case is to let ReportBase handle the styles and work around the threadlock issues by cleaning the styles prior to a new report being executed. Doing so has the effect of minimizing work in the utils.unique method making sure that before each report execution we have a minimum or more explicitely the relevant styles for our current report.

  Classes subclassing ReportBase should use the append_styles(self, styles) method instead of appending to styles directly.

  Better practice in utils.py

- Better practice in utils.py. [Dominic Montreuil]

  The link_callback wasn't really used...although it didn't cause harm either.

  generate_pdf and generate_pdf_template_object didn't return anything useful and whatever they returned wasn't used anyways. Pisa documentation recommends that such functions/methods return the generation errors for exception catching. Not implemented here, but just an overall better practice.

  Also is the addition of file_object.close(). You should manually close your StringIO objects as in some reported errors not closing them was the cause for massive slowdowns and hungry ressource usage by xhtml2pdf.

  All the recommended changes here are optional, but the StringIO manual close is recommended very highly to Pisa/xhtml2pdf users.

- Update setup.py. [Dominic Montreuil]

  I needed to use pdfutils along with another package that required httplib2 0.9 or higher.

  I tested pdfutils with httplib2 0.9 and everything works. It should be safe to update to the newer version of httplib2.
